				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I have been traveling like my parents told me to before we got seperated a week ago. It is always safer to keep moving, if you get too comfortable in one place, it is so much harder to leave. I do my best to ignore how gross I feel and keep moving north towards our winter cabin, hoping to meet up with my family there
