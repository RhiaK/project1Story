				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">As I slow down and start to relax, I notice a building on the left side of the road. It is a large brick building, maybe a warehouse or something. It could be a very safe place to lay low for a bit. I have had about enough of dealing with my own grossness and might be able to find a shower in here.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I open the door to a large dark room, I can barely see, it is so dark inside. There is a moaning noise coming from a little to the right, behind the door. I try to get a better look. Nothing has jumped out, so it should be safe.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I reach in my backpack and get out a flashlight that I try not to use, to save the battery. I shine it on the noise and see a woman with bites all over her. She appears to be in pain and is probably not far from turning into a zombie herself.</p>
