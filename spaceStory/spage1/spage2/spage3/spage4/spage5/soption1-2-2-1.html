				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I need Bo, he is my only companion, probably for the rest of my life. I know he's just a robot, but he has become my friend too. I look for any tracks he might have left, but I see none. I can only imagine he headed further away, or I would have seen him on my way here. That's the good thing about drilling next to a mountain, there's no way he would have tried climbing it, I don't think he even could.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">As I get further and further from the drill site, and my ship, I start to get uneasy. Where could he have gone? Could something have taken him??? I keep going till my oxygen is at half full. I know I have to head back now or I wont be able to make it back to the ship in time. I can only hope he returned to the drill site while I was looking for him.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">As I start heading back, I see something moving in the distance, could it be Bo? Should I head over there or keep going back to to the ship for more oxygen?
