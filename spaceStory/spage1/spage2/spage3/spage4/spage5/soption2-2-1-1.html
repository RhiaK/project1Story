				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I have been so lonely, I know it might be risky, but this puppy is just too cute. I decide I am going to keep him. I load him up into my backpack, leaving the top open so he can peek out and get enough air. He is so cute!</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I continue on my trek north to the family cabin. I keep it stealthy, sneaking behind the cars on the side of the road, trying to slink through the shadows. Right as I step out from a shadow to make my way to the next, the puppy yips, loudly.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I turn to look behind me and see a fast moving zombie right about to crash into us. I move out of the way and reach for my hammer. Right as I grab my hammer, the puppy tries to jump out of the backpack which is strapped to my back, he throws my balance off and I fall. The zombie lunges for me and begins tearing into me. At least I won't die alone, I think as I watch the puppy run under the nearest car. The last thing I see are his sad puppy eyes.
