				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I decide to go looking, he can't have gotten too far all by himself. I look around for a moment and don't see Bo anywhere....</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I take a look at my display and realize I have been looking for longer than I realized, I no loner have enough oxygen to get back to the ship. Maybe if I can find Bo, he can help get me back faster, it's my only hope now. I keep looking around, and again on the next hill, I see movement. I start running as fast as I can in my suit towards the hill up ahead.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I am quickly running out of oxygen and I don't think even Bo would be fast enough to save me now. This is not how I thought I would go out but I'm getting dizzy, it won't be long now....</p>
