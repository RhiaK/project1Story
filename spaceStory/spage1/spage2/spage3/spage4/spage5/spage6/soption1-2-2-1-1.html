				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I decide I just can't give up on Bo yet. I head towards the movement I saw at the top of the next small hill. When I get there, I see nothing, I look around for a moment and don't see Bo anywhere....</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I realize I no loner have enough oxygen to get back to the ship. Maybe if I can find Bo, he can help get me back faster, it's my only hope now. I keep looking around, and again on the next hill, I see movement. I start running as fast as I can in my suit towards that hill, but by the time I get there, whatever was moving is gone.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I am quickly running out of oxygen and I don't think even Bo would be fast enough to save me now. This is not how I thought I would go out, all that movement makes me think I am not alone on this moon, but what good is it, if I can never report that back....</p>
