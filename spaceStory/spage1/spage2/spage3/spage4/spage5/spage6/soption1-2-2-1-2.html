				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I need to head back to the ship. It is far more important that I survive this, than that I find Bo right now. I get back to the ship and still find no sign of Bo. I refill my oxygen supply, have some dinner and decide to stay in for the night. If Bo comes back during the night, he will probably just wait at the drill site. I can go check again in the morning.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">After a fitfull night of sleep, worrying about Bo, I head back to the drill site. I am just in time to see something peeking down into the hole I drilled. It jumps back and looks at me, surprise all over its face. Or at least I think it's surprise, I have never seen a face like this before. Bo is standing right beside it. I am so happy to see him unhurt. I guess he was off with the aliens.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">The alien comes closer to me and holds its hand out, I put my hand out in the same way and we touch palms. I am so happy that I always leave my camera on, just in case. The people back home are going to love this video.</p>
