				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I am sick of being cooped up in this ship, I want to explore something. I haven't gotten a very good look at this planet because of its orbit, but let's go check it out! I set my ship to land on planet 1. I am super excited, this is the farthest any human has been from Earth and I might find life!</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">When I land on the planet and get a good look at its make-up, I am sorely dissapointed. It is nothing but jagged cliffs and rock. I see no water, no life, nothing that looks like it would even be friendly to tardigrades. Maybe I should have waited and got some samples back form the other planets.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">Everything is just so rocky and sharp. I decide I should explore anyway, there might be more than the eye can see. I start collecting samples, readying them to take back to the ship. I walk a good deal, trying ot make sure I get a thorough idea of what is around here, but right as I turn to start my way back to the ship I twist my ankle slipping on some of the rocks.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">It hurts so bad, I don't think I can walk on it. I do my best anyway, mostly just dragging myself across the jagged rocks. This results in a tear in my suit and I think back on my recklessness as I lose more and more oxygen....</p>
