				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">The year is 2245 and I have the great honor to be one of Earth's first space explorers. This is a feeling that hasn't been felt since the likes of Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue. I get to see what has never been seen by human eyes, maybe even prove if alien life exists!
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I hop into my spaceship, complete with my robot companion Bo. Life can get pretty lonely out in the far reaches of space, but Bo will help with that. To build a stable spaceship that can be maneuverable enough for my needs, it must be small. Which means it only fits one human, one robot, and enough supplies to last me a life-time. 
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I will be sending regular messages back, but it is unlikely I will be able to return myself. We just don't have that kind of tech yet, but that's okay with me, I will get to live out my dream, regardless.
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I climb in my ship and look at my instrument panel. I receive a request to visit one of the moons of Jupiter, to get a closer look, and another to head out further to the edges of our galaxy, hmmm.....
